LEARNINGS AND EXPERIENCES

 1.) For the first problem while working with this Python code, I learned how to use numpy to generate a 5x5 array of random
  numbers and normalize it by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
  I also discovered how to save this processed data as a file using np.save(), which is useful for storing data for later use. 
  Seeing the original and normalized arrays printed out helped me understand how normalization works and how the numbers change to be centered around zero. 
  Overall, I gained a basic understanding of working with arrays, doing math on them, and saving data in Python.

2.) For the second problem,  I learned how to use np.arange() to create an array of the first 100 positive integers and square each of them. 
 I then reshaped the list into a 10x10 array, which was my first time organizing data like this. 
 The realization moment came when I filtered out the numbers divisible by 3 using X % 3 == 0â€”I suddenly understood how powerful numpy is for quickly manipulating data.
 Then I saved the filtered elements to a file with np.save(). Seeing the printed results helped me visualize the process and appreciate how Python makes working with data so intuitive.
 The comments really helps in simplifying the understanding lines of code in a system.
